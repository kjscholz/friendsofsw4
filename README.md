# Friends of SW4 reading group notes and scripts

## Session 1

In session 1 we started by just installing SW4 and learning how to run jobs on talapas.  Many of us had the same problem with installation from source so we opened a github issues and Obi-wan Kenobi ([Anders Petersson](https://people.llnl.gov/petersson1)) pointed out that it was an OpenMP issue that could be obviated by running <code>make sw4 openmp=no</code>.

## Session 2

Cancelled by icepocalypse 2024.

## Session 3

Starting with the [LLNL/CIG tutorial](https://github.com/UO-Geophysics/friendsofsw4/blob/main/SW4-tutorial-CIG.pdf), we explored the seismic1.in input file and took some [notes](https://github.com/UO-Geophysics/friendsofsw4/blob/main/sw4_notes.md) on what each component meant.
